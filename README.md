# NEON CO2 Macrosystems Final Project
Final project for GDA 2021 using NEON spatial data at 5 sites of interest

Short 1-2 sentence summary

## Background
Knowledge of meta-ecosystem carbon transport is limited and many large uncertainties remain in estimates of biosphere carbon cycling, sources, and sinks. In particular, terrestrially derived CO2 from respiration in soils, geochemical weathering, and stream metabolism all contribute to net CO2 emissions from inland waters, but their relative contributions to meta-ecosystem carbon fluxes are not well-quantified across seasons or biomes.  This research will quantify multi-scale properties of watershed carbon cycling by linking ecosystem processes with meta-ecosystem carbon fluxes in watersheds that have varying terrestrial productivity, soil carbon stocks, climate, geology, and hydrologic regimes. 

The research will be conducted at five National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) sites across the United States selected to represent a range of climate, hydrological, and productivity regimes. The following sites include an aquatic monitoring station co-located with a terrestrial monitoring station: 

|Aquatic Site     | Terrestrial Site           | Location  | NEON Descriptor* (Aquatic/Terrestrial)
| :------------- |:-------------| :-----| :---------
| King Creek      | Konza Prairie | Kansas | KING/KONZ
| Walker Branch      | Oak Ridge National Labratory | Ohio | WALK/ORNL
| Como Creek     | Niwot Ridge | Colorado | COMO/NIWO
| Martha Creek      | Wind River Experimental Forest | Washington |  MART/WREF
| Caribou Creek      | Caribou-Poker Creeks Research Watershed | Alaska | CARI/BONA

* *Used to download data off the NEON database for each site.*
