Short 1-2 sentence summary

## Background
Knowledge of meta-ecosystem carbon transport is limited and many large uncertainties remain in estimates of biosphere carbon cycling, sources, and sinks. In particular, terrestrially derived CO2 from respiration in soils, geochemical weathering, and stream metabolism all contribute to net CO2 emissions from inland waters, but their relative contributions to meta-ecosystem carbon fluxes are not well-quantified across seasons or biomes.  This research will quantify multi-scale properties of watershed carbon cycling by linking ecosystem processes with meta-ecosystem carbon fluxes in watersheds that have varying terrestrial productivity, soil carbon stocks, climate, geology, and hydrologic regimes. 

To aid in this research, it will be important to understand the total biomass, the gross primary production, and the net primary production at each site. The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) conducts airborne remote survey over 47 field sites through out the United States. The surveys are supported by the NEON Airborne Observation Platform (AOP), a collection of instruments installed into a light aircraft designed to collect high resolution remote sensing data at low altitude. The remote sensing data will be used to answer some of the research questions of interest. 

The research will be conducted at five NEON sites across the United States selected to represent a range of climate, hydrological, and productivity regimes. The sites include an aquatic monitoring station co-located with a terrestrial monitoring station: 

|Aquatic Site     | Terrestrial Site           | Location  | NEON Descriptor<sup>1</sup> (Aquatic/Terrestrial)
| :------------- |:-------------| :-----| :---------
| King Creek      | Konza Prairie | Kansas | KING/KONZ
| Walker Branch      | Oak Ridge National Labratory | Ohio | WALK/ORNL
| Como Creek     | Niwot Ridge | Colorado | COMO/NIWO
| Martha Creek      | Wind River Experimental Forest | Washington |  MART/WREF
| Caribou Creek      | Caribou-Poker Creeks Research Watershed | Alaska | CARI/BONA
